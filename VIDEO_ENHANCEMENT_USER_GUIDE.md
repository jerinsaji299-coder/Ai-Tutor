## 🎯 How Content is Used for Video Search

### Content-Based Search Enhancement
The system analyzes the **module content** to create more relevant video searches:

**Example:**
```json
{
  "week": 1,
  "topic": "Introduction to Python",
  "content": "Learn Python basics including variables, data types, operators, and control flow. Students will understand how to write simple programs and debug common errors."
}
```

**Generated Searches:**
1. "Introduction to Python tutorial"
2. "Introduction to Python explained with examples"
3. "Introduction to Python variables" ← Extracted from content
4. "Introduction to Python operators" ← Extracted from content
5. "Introduction to Python control" ← Extracted from content

### Key Features:
- 🔍 **Keyword Extraction**: Pulls important terms from content
- 🎯 **Context-Aware**: Videos match both topic AND content
- 📚 **Smart Filtering**: Ignores common words, focuses on concepts
- 🤖 **AI Summaries**: Each video gets an intelligent summary based on:
  - Video title and description
  - Module learning objectives
  - Content context

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Selective Module Enhancement
- ⚡ **Faster**: Process only modules you need
